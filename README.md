### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Recently, I have been working on a React-Native mobile application for unified communication and collaboration. I started this project 18 months ago with the initial proof of concept. Our latest release involves 7 teams counting 50 contributors. We ship a client-facing mobile application used by 55k daily active users. Our team is responsible for hosting the different experiences such as voice, meeting and messaging in addition to the transversal concerns, the developer experience and the release processes for all the teams.
